# DA - Design of Algorithms

This repository contains two projects developed as part of the **DA - Design of Algorithms** course at **FEUP** in 2025.

## Projects Overview

1. **Route Planning System** (First Project):  
   A graph-based route planning system designed to optimize travel within a city, combining walking, driving, and hybrid (multi-modal) routing capabilities. The system supports environment-friendly navigation, restricted route planning, and customizable travel preferences using efficient graph-based algorithms.

2. **Delivery Truck Pallet Loading Optimization** (Second Project):  
   A system designed to optimize the loading of pallets onto a truck by solving the knapsack problem. The project provides several optimization algorithms (Brute Force, Dynamic Programming, Greedy Approximation, Integer Linear Programming) to find the optimal or near-optimal solution for maximizing the profit of loaded pallets, without exceeding the truck's weight capacity.

## Project Structure

- `DA_Project1/`  
  Contains the first project's code related to route planning, including graph handling, routing algorithms, and user interface.

- `DA_Project2/`  
  Contains the second project's code for the delivery truck pallet loading optimization, including the various algorithms and data structures used to solve the optimization problem.
